            <h3>Key Privacy Highlights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information</li>
                <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> Use the app without creating an account or providing personal details</li>
                <li><strong>Local Camera Processing:</strong> Camera data is processed entirely on your device and never recorded or stored</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Privacy:</strong> What happens on your device, stays on your device</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Push Up Talk</span> is designed with privacy as a core principle. <strong>We do not collect any personal information, user data, or identifiable information</strong> from users of our application.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app operates entirely locally on your device and does not require users to create accounts, provide email addresses, phone numbers, or any other personal information to use the application.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Camera Usage and Data Processing</h2>
        <h3>Camera Access</h3>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Push Up Talk</span> may request access to your iPhone's camera for the sole purpose of detecting and counting push-up repetitions during workouts.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Local Processing Only</h3>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> All camera data processing occurs entirely on your device. The camera feed is used in real-time for push-up detection and counting, but:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No camera data is recorded or saved</li>
                <li>No images or videos are stored on your device</li>
                <li>No camera data is transmitted to external servers</li>
                <li>Camera access can be revoked at any time through iOS Settings</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <p>
            Any workout data (such as push-up counts, workout history, and statistics) is stored locally on your device using iOS's built-in data storage capabilities. This data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Remains on your device at all times</li>
            <li>Is not accessible to us or any third parties</li>
            <li>Can be deleted by uninstalling the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="app-name">Push Up Talk</span> does not integrate with or use any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The app operates independently without external dependencies that could compromise your privacy.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
        <p>
            The app may request the following permissions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> Only for push-up detection and counting, processed locally</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> To save your workout data on your device</li>
            <li><strong>HealthKit:</strong> To synchronize your workout data with your Apple Health app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            All permissions are optional and can be managed through your iOS device settings. The app will function with limited features if certain permissions are not granted.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Our app does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13. Since no data collection occurs, there are no special provisions needed for children's data protection, though we recommend parental supervision for all app usage by minors.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            Since all data remains on your device and no information is transmitted externally, your data security is primarily managed by your device's built-in iOS security features. We recommend:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeping your iOS device updated with the latest security patches</li>
            <li>Using device lock features (Face ID, Touch ID, or passcode)</li>
            <li>Regularly backing up your device if you want to preserve workout data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <p>
            Since we don't collect personal data, traditional data rights (like access, deletion, or portability requests) don't apply. However, you maintain complete control over your data:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data can be deleted by uninstalling the app</li>
            <li>Camera permissions can be revoked at any time</li>
            <li>Workout data remains under your complete control</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the app and on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
        </p>

        <h2>10. International Users</h2>
        <p>
            Since <span class="app-name">Push Up Talk</span> operates entirely locally on your device without data transmission, there are no international data transfer concerns. Your data never leaves your device regardless of your location.
        </p>
